Drive Train: 4 Motor standard, 4-6 wheels it will most likely change with testing.
Launcher: Chain of 1-3 motor(s) working together to draw back a hammer attached to various strength rubber bands. Once drawn back its released and launches the triballs forward.
Picker(Maybe): A set of rollres put together with 1 motor or less used to sweep up triballs into the launcher.
Sweeper: Using a pnuematic piston positioned in the middle of the chasis to spread out *wings on either side to push triballs under goal.
Elevation Mechanism: Using a set of 3-4 pnuematic piston to raise a claw onto the pole, then the pnuematics retract and a new set of claws attach then the system repeats.
