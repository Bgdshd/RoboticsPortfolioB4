*Drive Train: 4 Motor standard, 4-6 wheels it will most likely change with testing. It will have decent strength and speed without sacraficing too much weight or space inside the chassis.

*Launcher: Chain of 1-3 motor(s) working together to draw back a hammer attached to various strength rubber bands. Once drawn back its released and launches the triballs forward.

*Picker(Maybe): A set of rollres put together with 1 motor or less used to sweep up triballs into the launcher.

*Sweeper: Using a pnuematic piston positioned in the middle of the chasis to spread out *wings on either side to push triballs under goal.

*Elevation Mechanism: Using a set of 3-4 pnuematic piston to raise a claw onto the pole, then the pnuematics retract and a new set of claws attach then the system repeats.

8. Motor Limitations: 11W and 5.5W configurations may not exceed the use of 88W.
9. May only use 1 VEX battery to power the robot.
10. Cannot modify electronic components.
11. Robots have to use VEXnet
12. Limited amounts of custom plastic and tape allowed.
13. One or two controllers per robot.
Use a competition template for programming.

# Autonomous Period Win Point
  Removed triball from load zone.
  Scored at least on alliance triball on alliance goal.
  Ended the autonomous period contacting their own elevation bar.
